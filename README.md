# To clone this repo:
## Install Git https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
## Verify install with terminal command $git --version
## Open Terminal, change directories into a project folder.. I made a new directory called 'dev' by $mkdir ~/dev
## Change directories to your project folder & copy/paste the following git command:
### git clone https://github.com/jkitsimple/learnTheHardWay.git
## Then change directories into the folder learnTheHardWay (for me $cd ~/dev/learnTheHardWay) & congrats you now have the github repo on your local machine!

Going to keep this as a learning repo.. for Zed Shaw's Book Series 'Learn The Hard Way' for brushing up on the syntax of programming languages.
